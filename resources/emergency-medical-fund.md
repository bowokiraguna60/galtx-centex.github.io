On September 17, 2005, we lost a long-time devoted friend when Dr. Real Ransom and his wife were killed in a plane crash near Houston. Dr. Ransom was the founder of Great Oaks Animal Hospital and had worked closely with our group since 1992. He gave generously of his time and service, and is remembered for his warmth and compassion.

To honor his memory, the "Real Ransom III DVM Emergency Medical Fund" was created.  Donations to this fund are used exclusively for our foster or adopted greyhounds with extreme needs.

If you are an adopter with an extenuating circumstance, email [president@galtx-centex.org](mailto:president@galtx-centex.org).
