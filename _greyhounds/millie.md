Millie had a brief go at a racing career at Tri-State in West Virginia. After nine races she hung up her track shoes and headed for Texas. Millie is settling in quickly with the help of a greyhound mentor in the home.  She is sweet, food motivated, but mostly wants to plop her down in your lap, giving those "love me" eyes. Her foster family is helping her to work through some separation anxiety; she is just such a young one and her world has changed dramatically.  Millie is gentle and wants to please. We think she will make a great addition to any family (cat test pending.)
