Hi!  My name is Sam McGee.  I have been very busy while in my first ever foster home where I have two greyhound foster siblings.  I have learned “heel up” and “let’s go”. I have also learned “target” which Foster Mom taught me so I would focus on her and Foster Dad.  I have also picked up “wait”, but I am really only good at it when at the front door, I am still working on waiting to get out of the van.  Guess what else I can do?  In my foster home, there are bells hanging on the door knob.  When I have to go potty, I hit the bells and someone comes running to let me out.  It is the coolest thing ever! 

I really want a forever home where I can get on beds and furniture as I finally wore Foster Mom down.  She took me off the couch 30 times in one morning, but I kept getting back up there because it was so comfy, plus my foster sister gets on the couch all the time.  Foster Mom caved on the furniture, but she refuses to let me table and counter surf, despite my best attempts.  She says I need to have some manners for my forever family.  I like to play with toys and I like to grab boxes from the recycle bin and drag them around the house.  Foster Mom says I need to be supervised pretty regularly right now because I am learning how to be a forever family member.  One thing you should know about me is that I have zero space issues.  I will settle down next to anybody.  My foster sister is bossy and growls at me.  I just look at her and most of the time move away.  I haven’t been left alone yet, but Foster Mom says we are going to try that soon.  I will let you know how that goes.  Right now, I am just a loveable boy that wants a family who will cuddle with me and give me lots of attention.
