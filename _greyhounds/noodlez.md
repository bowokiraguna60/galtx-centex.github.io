This happy, confident girl will greet you with a wagging tail and sweet kisses.  She loves her toys and her treats. Her foster mom calls her a "happy hoover" as Noodlez will gladly clean up all the crumbs left by her housemate.  Noodlez currently lives with a male Greyhound, but probably not suitable for any smaller creatures.  She learned the doggie door on day one, and has been a perfect guest.
