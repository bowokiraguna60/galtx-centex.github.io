I'm a Texas gal, born and bred! I had a racing career for two years, and then returned to the farm to raise two litters of pups. This new life of leisure is pretty sweet - long morning walks, followed by a lounge in the garden. When it gets warm, I move to my indoor puffy bed. I pride myself on having proper house manners, and never make a mess. I get along well the cat and smaller dog in my foster family.
