Walter was found as a stray - underweight, and full of parasites including Heartworms. Despite whatever he has experienced in his past, Walter is a joyful, mischievious puppy. We believe he will make a wonderful family pet. 
Update: Walter has now completed Heartworm treatments without complication! Also, his Embark DNA analysis confirms what we suspected.  He is equal parts Greyhound and Saluki, and all together adorable!
