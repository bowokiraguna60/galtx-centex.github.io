Walter was found as a stray - underweight, and full of parasites including Heartworms. Not tattooed, he appears to be a Saluki cross. He will need a few months in foster care to complete medical treatment. Despite whatever he has experienced in his past, Walter is a joyful, mischievious puppy. We believe he will make a wonderful family pet.
