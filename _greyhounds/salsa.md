¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Salsa!

Although my name is Salsa, you can say I am the mild variety.  I am a sweet, smaller girl with a pretty white coat.  Like my sisters Soho, Selena and Suzy, I was rather timid at first.  Then I learned that squeaky toys are awesome!  Also, I have a bit of a crush on the older boy greyhound in my foster home.  I feel safe when I lay near him.

Foster mom here: Salsa is like any youngster.  She spends her days playing, exploring her world and then snuggling up in mama’s lap for some loving.  She has a cute puppyish yip when she wants your attention and is quite fond of meals and treats.  Salsa is very gentle and will make a great addition to any family.
