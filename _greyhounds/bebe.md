Bebe has discovered the couch is the best bed in the house and sleeps there at night now.  She has been a perfect guest in her foster home, never has had an accident and is unbothered by the kitties.  Chasing squirrels and walks are her favourite outdoor activities and she has the cutest ears when she sees something interesting.  Bebe has acclimated to this pet life with ease.
