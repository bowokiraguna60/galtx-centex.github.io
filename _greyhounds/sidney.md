Hi! I am Sidney, but I like it when foster mom calls me Sid-Sid.
My favorite things about pet life are: my plushy toy, ham-flavored baby food mixed with my kibble, and having my ears rubbed.
I really don't like loud anything: traffic, people, the vacuum, etc.
I have been told I walk on the leash well and I get compliments everywhere I go.
I get along with my foster brother Peter (chihuahua) and foster sister Jade (cat).
I can be a bit shy, but foster mom keeps telling me I am going to be a Greyt pet with the right forever home!

I can't wait to be with my new family in time for the holidays!
