My official racing name was "Let's Go Girls" and I am pretty proud of my 31 finishes all around Victoria and New South Wales, Australia.  When my handlers decided to retire me, I said "let's go" to the USA where maybe I can meet Shania ;) 

So far, I haven't spotted any celebrities, but life is good here. My foster family includes a Greyhound and another mixed breed dog of similar size. We go on walks every morning, and chase squirrels and lizards every afternoon.  There is a huge drinking hole in the backyard; foster mom calls me smart because I walk right up to the edge, but never fall in. Foster mom puts ice cubes in my much smaller indoor drinking bowl, which I like to fish out and take to my bed. Where did it go?

Girlie is probably too prey-driven for a home with small animals or very young children.  House-trained, crate-trained, eats well, walks nicely on leash, healthy and ready for her next adventure!  She has been an excellent house guest -Dona
