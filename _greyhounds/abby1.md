My proper name is “Fuzzy’s Abigail”, but everyone calls me Abby.  I am seven years old, which means I still enjoy playing with toys, going on walks, and even a short zoomie around the living room each morning.  It also means, I am calm and quiet when you are trying to work or sleep, and I am no longer interested in chewing on furniture or shoes.

 

I recently had several teeth extracted, but that hasn’t slowed me down any; I never missed a meal!  I really hate the feeling of wet grass, so be patient with me as I find my perfect potty spot. 

 

I live in a foster home with other similar sized dogs, not all greyhounds.  They showed me a cat when I visited the vet clinic – meh.  

 

In my younger days, I raced in Florida and did pretty good.  Then I went back to the farm where I had lots of pups; I was good at that too.  Now I would like to show you how good I can be as a family pet.
