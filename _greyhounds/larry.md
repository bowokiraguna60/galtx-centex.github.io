G'day mates. Larry is my name. My race career in New South Wales was a bit of a bust, so here I am in Texas testing the waters as a pet. In my short time in my foster home, I have learned to use the stairs and the doggie door.  I love to go for walks with my family and foster mum calls me "amazing".
