I'm a special boy looking for a special home!  Akima is a domestic, former racer. Sadly, his retirement did not go as planned. He was attacked by some other dogs, and lost his front left leg to extensive injuries. Nevertheless, he is a happy, tail-wagging, rooing, handsome boy, who is adapting well. He is looking for a home without stairs or obstacles to navigate. 

UPDATE: Akima, also called Kiki by his foster family, is fully healed and ready for his next adventure. "Ki" has learned how to use the doggie door, he loves his toys, and loves to go for walks in the neighborhood.  He is an active boy!
