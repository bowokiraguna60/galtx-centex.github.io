I'm a special boy looking for a special home!  Akima is a domestic, former racer. Sadly, his retirement did not go as planned. He was attacked by some other dogs, and lost his front left leg to extensive injuries. Nevertheless, he is a happy, tail-wagging, rooing, handsome boy, who is adapting well. He is looking for a home without stairs or obstacles to navigate.
