Precious Finnegan came to us when his owner passed away. We don't know much of his prior history. Finn is not tattooed, and is a slim 50 lbs. We believe him to be a "Grey-luki". He has lived with small dogs (not sure about cats). He is currently on hold while we get him up to date on his medical needs.
