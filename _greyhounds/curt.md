Curt is young and athletic.  He would enjoy an active family who will toss a tennis ball or frisbee in their fenced yard. He is strong, and will need some leash training.  Inside the house, Curt has been a wonderful guest - no accidents, no chewing, and super cuddly. He will gladly announce the arrival of the delivery driver and the lawn service for you.

We believe Curt is littermate to Toby.
