Curt is young and exuberant.  He would enjoy meeting an active family who will toss a tennis ball or frisbee in their fenced yard. His foster family is working with him on leash manners.  Inside the house, Curt has been a wonderful guest - no accidents, no chewing, and SUPER cuddly. He will gladly announce the arrival of the delivery driver and the lawn service for you.

We believe Curt is littermate to Toby. He previously lived with cats and a small dog.
