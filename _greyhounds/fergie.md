Fergie is great with kids, great with cats - NOT great with thunderstorms. We think Fergie would do best with a canine friend to share life's journey with. Although she may be timid around new people and places, Fergie has learned to love car rides and neighborhood walks. Fergie takes daily medication to manage her anxiety.
