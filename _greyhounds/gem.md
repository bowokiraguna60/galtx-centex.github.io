Gem is a happy-go-lucky girl who still has a puppyish charm. This gal was recently imported from the Australian racing industry, but we found no races on her record. No worries there, she is destined to be someone's wiggly-waggly, lovey-dovey family pet. Cat and small animal tests pending, but shows promise.
